This Javascript-based Library allows an education provider to integrate web-based external Tools into their chosen learning Platform, such as Moodle, Blackboard, Edgenuity, etc, without needing to understand the underlying Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standards (https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability).  This Library supports the LTI 1.3 Core standards, which implements up-to-date privacy and security standards. It also provides limited support the Assignment and Grade Services.  In the future, this Library will be updated to fully support the LTI Advantage extensions for Assignments/Grades. At this time, LTI Advantage Names and Roles Provisioning Services and Deep Linking is not supported.
